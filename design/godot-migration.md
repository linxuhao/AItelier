# Unity → Godot game-harness migration

AItelier's agents were "blind" to Unity runtime problems: the compile gate caught
C# errors, but the PlayMode smoke test needed a ~14GB licensed editor image, was
slow/flaky, and gave little structured runtime insight. This migration replaces
the Unity harness with a Godot 4 one that is **strictly more agent-observable**,
and moves the game gate out of the base DPE pipeline into a composable **addon**.

## What was built

### ① Godot harness (`aitelier/tools/godot_{compile,playtest}` + `docker/godot`)
- `godot_compile` → `godot --headless --import` parse-checks every GDScript +
  scene; errors carry `res://` file + line. Chains `godot_playtest`. Preserves
  the `gate_skipped` fail-open→observable contract.
- `godot_playtest` → runs the main scene headless for N frames with an injected
  autoload **probe** that: caps fps for stable timing, auto-presses `ui_accept`
  so the game progresses, captures **runtime errors** (`SCRIPT ERROR`/`push_error`
  with file+line), and snapshots the **live scene-tree state** (each scripted
  node's variables + transform).
- `godot-builder` sidecar: python-slim + the free Godot 4 binary. **672MB, no
  license, no account, no secrets** — vs the Unity editor image's **14.3GB**.

### ② skillflow overlay / addon system (`skillflow.compose`)
A base graph declares named **anchors**; **addon** fragments inject steps
(`insert_after`) and wire context (`add_context`) at those anchors, resolved into
one graph *before* validation. The base DPE pipeline (`dpe_default.yaml`) is now
engine-agnostic; the Godot gate lives in `configs/addons/game_harness.yaml`,
spliced in at registration (`api/dependencies.py`). Swap engines (web, mobile)
by editing the base's `overlays:` list — never by forking the pipeline.

### Migration
Removed the Unity tools, sidecar, `Dockerfile.unity`, compose service, and
`UNITY_*` secrets. Rewrote the agent-facing templates (architect / implementer /
verifier / meta) for Godot conventions — dramatically simpler because Godot
`.tscn` scenes are **text**: no build-scene-in-code bootstrapper, no
`#if UNITY_EDITOR`, no bake menu, no reflection wiring.

Tests: 447 skillflow (12 new compose) + 589 AItelier unit (14 new Godot, incl.
real-binary integration) + 48 pipeline integration — all green.

## Drive: `flappy-bird-godot` vs `flappy-bird-unity`

A faithful Godot 4 port (same tuning: gravity, flap, pipe speed, spawn interval,
gap) driven through the real harness. The auto-playtest hovers the bird and
**scores 4 in 10s with zero runtime errors**; the state snapshot shows the agent
the live `score`, `state`, and bird `position`/`velocity_y`/`alive`. Injecting a
null-deref (invisible to the parse gate) is **caught by the playtest gate** with
`res://scripts/bird.gd line 32` — the exact runtime blindness that shipped 7 C#
errors in the Unity days.

| | Unity flappy bird | Godot flappy bird |
|---|---|---|
| Tracked files | 74 | **10** |
| Gameplay-script LOC | 1307 (12 `.cs`) | **196 (7 `.gd`)** |
| Total tracked LOC | 5833 | **322** |
| Scene delivery | rebuilt in code (`SceneBootstrapper`) + bake menu | **text `.tscn`, diffable, authored directly** |
| Placeholder art | `Placeholders` util (runtime `Texture2D` gen) | **built-in primitive nodes** (`Polygon2D`/`ColorRect`) |
| Builder image | 14.3 GB, licensed editor, account+2FA | **672 MB, no license/account/secrets** |
| Compile gate | Roslyn whole-repo C# compile | `--import` GDScript parse (file+line) |
| Runtime gate | PlayMode smoke (pass/fail, slow) | **headless run: errors w/ file+line + live state snapshot** |
| Agent sees runtime state | no | **yes** (`score`, `position`, `velocity`, `game_state`, …) |

The win isn't just smaller/cheaper — it's that a runtime problem now has a
precise, structured signal an autonomous agent can act on, which the closed Unity
toolchain could not provide.

## Drive #2: `capsule-dash-godot` vs `capsule-dash-3d` (3D)

A faithful GDScript port of the Unity 3D endless runner (same tuning: forward
speed 8, lanes ±2.5, jump 10, gravity −25, spawn 35 ahead, gap 6–16), driven
through the **real** AItelier tool path — the `godot_compile` / `godot_playtest`
tools hitting the `godot-builder` sidecar container over HTTP, not the host
script. Parse OK (6 scripts), playtest clean; the probe's **Node3D** snapshot
shows the agent full 3D state — player `pos [0, 2.85, 0]` (mid-jump height),
obstacles by lane/z, distance climbing to 77 m, and the death→restart cycle. A
parse-clean null-node bug is caught at `player.gd:45`.

| | Unity capsule-dash-3d | Godot capsule-dash |
|---|---|---|
| Tracked files | 413 | **11** |
| Gameplay-script LOC | 2375 (14 `.cs`) | **206 (6 `.gd`)** |
| Total tracked LOC | 5517 | **360** |
| Unity-only scaffolding | SceneBootstrapper 299 + SceneBaker 141 + Placeholders 106 (~546 LOC) | **0 — scenes are text** |

## Addon system (final shape)

The `game_harness` gate is not baked into the base DPE pipeline — it's a
**base-bound addon** composed via `skillflow.compose`. An addon contributes all
four kinds of thing at named base anchors, so the base pipeline carries no game
steps *and no game prompts*:

- **steps / tools** — `insert_after`: the Godot compile+playtest gate, and a
  `scaffold` tool step that drops a Godot `.gitignore` into the repo
  (mechanical, LLM-independent).
- **context** — `add_context`: the verifier reads the gate reports.
- **prompt fragments** — `add_template`: Godot conventions reach the architect /
  implementer / verifier prompts only when the addon is applied
  (`configs/addons/game_harness/*.md`).

An addon declares `base:` + optional `alias:`; `run(base, [addons])` composes an
emergent-named config, or the alias (`game_harness` → `dpe_game`) is boot-
registered and runnable by name. `list_pipeline_addons` is the discovery surface.
The base (`dpe_default_v2`) is now verified engine-agnostic.

The addon contributes all four kinds of thing at named anchors, each with its own
delivery channel:

| Contribution | Channel | game_harness example |
|---|---|---|
| steps | `insert_after` | the compile+playtest gate (`5_compile`) |
| tools | `insert_after` a tool step | `scaffold` drops a Godot `.gitignore` (mechanical, LLM-independent; merges into an existing one) |
| context | `add_context` | verifier reads the gate reports |
| prompts | `add_template` | Godot conventions reach architect/implementer/verifier prompts only when applied |

## Butler autonomy + live DPE run

The butler now picks the game pipeline itself: a `list_pipeline_addons` tool +
`approve_project_brief(config_name=...)` threaded onto the project row, and a
`SYSTEM_PROMPT` that says "game → dpe_game". Deployed to the live container
(compose-enabled skillflow wheel + godot-builder sidecar), a real `dpe_game`
build (`flappy-godot-dpe`) ran real agents through researcher → review →
architect → review → PM → review with **the addon fully live**: the `gh_scaffold`
tool step executed, the godot gate (`5_compile`) is queued, and the
`game_harness/architect.md` **fragment reached the live architect prompt**
(step2_design.md contains Polygon2D / ColorRect / ui_accept / autoload / res:// —
terms only in the fragment, never in the brief). Two integration bugs the drive
surfaced were fixed (scaffold merge vs the workspace's default .gitignore; DPE
seeding keyed on the brief contract so composed pipelines seed).

## Content comparison: capsule-dash Godot vs Unity (per concern)

Same gameplay, every concern far smaller — and ~1200 LOC of Unity-only
scaffolding simply doesn't exist:

| Concern | Unity `.cs` | Godot `.gd` |
|---|---|---|
| Game state / score | GameManager 118 | game_manager 58 |
| Player (lanes, jump, death) | PlayerController 226 | player 56 |
| Obstacle spawner | ObstacleSpawner 239 | obstacle_spawner 40 |
| Obstacle | Obstacle 115 | obstacle 13 |
| Camera | CameraFollow 100 | static in `.tscn` (0) |
| HUD | UIManager 306 | ui 26 |
| **Unity-only scaffolding** | SceneBootstrapper 299 + Placeholders 106 + SceneBaker 141 + InputHandler 138 (+ LaneMarker/WindEffect cosmetics 562) | **none — scenes are text, primitives are nodes, Input is built-in** |
